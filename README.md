## What is Webshell?
#### A web shell is a shell-like interface that enables a web server to be remotely accessed, often for the purposes of cyberattacks. A web shell is unique in that a web browser is used to interact with it. A web shell could be programmed in any programming language that is supported on a server.

<br>

## Features

##### - Exfiltrating and harvesting sensitive information and credentials.
##### - Uploading malware, which can potentially create a watering hole for further infection and scanning of other victims.
##### - Defacing websites by modifying or adding files.
